## Golden State Warriors Roster 2023-24

As part of their roster for the 2023-24 season, the Warriors will have a mix of experienced veterans and promising youth:

PG: Stephen Curry, Lester Quinones, Brandin Podziemski
SG: Klay Thompson, Gary Payton II
SF: Andrew Wiggins, Moses Moody
PF: Jonathan Kuminga, Dario Saric
C: Draymond Green, Kevon Looney, Trayce Jackson-Davis

With this roster, the Warriors are poised to make a strong run in the 2024 NBA season. Exciting matchups against rivals such as the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics will test the team's mettle, but the combination of experience and youth should prove to be a potent mix for Golden State.
