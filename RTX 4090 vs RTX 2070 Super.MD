### Efficiency and Power Consumption

The RTX 4090 may be powerful, but it's also efficient. It boasts an impressive efficiency score of 80, while its power consumption stands at 450W. Compared to the RTX 2070 Super (with a power consumption of 215W and an efficiency score of 47), you'll find that the RTX 4090 is 70.2% more energy-efficient, which means it will save you money in both power usage and potential upgrades down the line!

### FP32 Performance

The RTX 4090 is a powerhouse when it comes to raw computing performance. Its FP32 performance clocks in at an impressive +811% increase over the RTX 2070 Super, with 82.58 TFLOPS of processing power. That's enough juice to handle even the most complex graphics tasks you throw at it.

### Rendering Cores and DLSS 3

If you love eye-catching visuals in your games, you'll be delighted to know that the RTX 4090 has 13,136 more rendering cores than the RTX 2070 Super (a total of 16,384 compared to 5,120). Plus, it supports NVIDIA's cutting-edge DLSS 3 technology for even better frame rates and stunning image quality.

### NVIDIA Reflex and Gaming Value

Last but not least, the RTX 4090 comes with a low-latency platform called NVIDIA Reflex. This feature is perfect for competitive gamers who want to gain a decisive edge. And with an impressive 13.3% better value for money when compared to the RTX 2070 Super, it's clear that this graphics card is worth every penny.

## RTX 2070 Super Specification

When we're comparing the RTX 4090 with its predecessor, it's essential to know what kind of power the older GPU packs. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 Super is a solid option for those looking for high-end performance at a relatively lower price point compared to newer models like the RTX 4090. Let's dive into its specifications!

### CUDA Cores and Clock Speeds

The RTX 2070 Super has 2560 CUDA cores, which is still a lot considering the vast majority of games don't require more than 1800 CUDA cores for optimal performance. Its base clock speed stands at 1405 MHz and can boost up to 1770 MHz. Remember that these speeds may vary depending on cooling and power limits.

### Memory

The RTX 2070 Super comes with 8GB GDDR6 VRAM, similar to the RTX 4090. However, it has a narrower memory bus at 256-bit, resulting in a slightly lower memory bandwidth of around 448 GB/s compared to the RTX 4090's 760.8 GB/s.

### Power Consumption and Price

The RTX 2070 Super has a lower power consumption requirement, with a TDP (Thermal Design Power) of just 215 watts. This translates to less demand on your power supply and potentially cooler running temperatures. On the other hand, the price is another story: when it was first launched, you could get your hands on an RTX 2070 Super for $499, but now it's available at around $309, which is a steal compared to the RTX 4090's current market price of $1,756.

### Performance and Release Date

The RTX 2070 Super delivers strong gaming performance that can handle most modern games on high settings. However, its synthetic benchmark score sits at a respectable 47.04 (with 100 representing a 100% increase over the original RTX 2070). Released back in August 2018, it might not be as cutting-edge as the latest releases but remains a solid performer for its age.

In summary, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 Super offers a balance between power and affordability. While it may not have all the bells and whistles of the newer RTX 4090, it still packs quite a punch in terms of performance

## Which One Better For Price Value in Gaming

When it comes to getting the most bang for your buck while enjoying your favorite games, comparing the price value is an essential factor. Let's dive into how these two graphic cards fare against each other when considering gaming performance and cost efficiency.

The RTX 2070 Super offers up to **38% better value for money** when playing Assassin's Creed Mirage than the RTX 4090, according to the given source. Moreover, it consumes up to **52% less energy**, making it an attractive choice for those who prioritize both gaming performance and energy savings.

In terms of specifications, the RTX 4090 has significant advantages over its predecessor, the RTX 2070 Super. It comes with a much higher memory capacity, faster clock speeds, and improved CUDA cores. However, these improvements do come at a cost.

When comparing the price value rating of both graphic cards, the RTX 2070 Super has a **194% higher value rating** compared to the RTX 4090. This means that for every dollar spent on an RTX 2070 Super, you'll likely receive more in terms of gaming performance and overall value than if you were to invest in the pricier RTX 4090.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, while the RTX 4090 offers impressive power and top-notch performance, it comes at a steep price. The RTX 2070 Super, on the other hand, offers significantly better value for money when it comes to gaming, consuming less energy in the process.
