## 1. The Power of Great Meat
Great meat starts with great steak, and we're not talking about just any steak – we're talking about *grass-fed* goodness! These cows munch on grass instead of being fed grain, which results in a healthier and more flavorful steak. So, always look for grass-fed beef when selecting your next cut of steak.

## 2. Defrosting and Preparing the Steak
Before you can cook the perfect steak, you've got to defrost it properly. The key here is water – place your steak in a bowl or zip-top bag and submerge it in cold water for an hour. This ensures even defrosting without compromising the steak's quality.

Once defrosted, let your steak come up to room temperature before cooking. Trust us; it makes a huge difference! Pat the steak dry with paper towels before cooking for maximum caramelization and crust formation.

## 3. Cooking Perfection with a Super Hot Pan
Now, it's time to get that pan sizzling! A super hot cast iron skillet is your best friend when cooking steak – it retains heat like nobody's business, ensuring even cooking and perfect browning. Make sure your pan is very hot before adding the oil of your choice (high smoke point oils such as avocado, soybean, canola or clarified butter).

Once the oil is hot, add the steak to the pan and flip it often while cooking. Don't overcook the steak – use a meat thermometer to ensure perfection! Remember: less is more when it comes to grilling. When the steak reaches your desired doneness (medium-rare to medium), remove it from the pan and let it rest before serving.

## 4. Choosing the Perfect Type of Steak
When selecting a type of steak, opt for ribeye or sirloin – they are both 2-2.5cm thick with thin veins of fat that add great flavor to your dish. But if you're feeling adventurous, there are also some underrated steaks to try such as flank, skirt, thick skirt, thin skirt, feather steak (flat iron steak), and more! Your local butcher can help you choose the best cut for your taste buds. Just make sure they remove any sinew in the middle of feather steak before selling it to you.

## 5. Sauce and Seasonings for a Flavor Explosion
Seasoning is crucial when cooking the perfect steak. Stick to high-quality salt as your primary seasoning. For additional flavor, consider using garlic, thyme or rosemary, and baste the steak with butter during the last minute of cooking for a truly mouthwatering result.

## 6. Resting, Slicing, and Serving
Resting your steak is as important as cooking it correctly. Let your masterpiece sit for at least as long as it was cooked (e.g., if you cooked the steak for 4 minutes, let it rest for 4-5 minutes). This allows the juices to settle back into the meat, ensuring a succulent and flavorful experience with every bite.

When it comes time to slice your rested steak, use a sharp knife and cut against the grain of the muscle fibers. This will make each bite tender and easy to chew. Finally, serve your perfectly cooked steak alongside your favorite side dishes or sauces, and enjoy the fruits of your labor!

## Bonus: Unique and Underrated Steaks to Try
As previously mentioned, here are some underrated steaks with more detail that you may want to try:
- **Flank**: A lean cut with a distinct flavor, great for grilling or slow cooking.
- **Skirt**: A thin, flat cut that can be tough if not cooked properly but is full of flavor when done right.
- **Thick skirt**: Similar to the regular skirt steak but thicker, making it more suitable for slow cooking and braising.
- **Thin skirt**: Thinner than the thick skirt steak, this cut works best when cooked quickly over high heat on a griddle or barbecue.
- **Feather steak (flat iron steak)**: A flavorful cut with excellent marbling, perfect for pan-searing or grilling.
- **Hanger steak**: A tender and flavorful cut that's often overlooked but can be cooked to perfection when prepared correctly.

Now that you have all these fantastic tips, go ahead and conquer the world of grilled perfection! You'll soon become a steak grilling champion in no time. Happy cooking, my friend!
