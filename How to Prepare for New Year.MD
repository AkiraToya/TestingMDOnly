After reflecting on the past year, it's time to look forward and set goals for the new one. Setting clear objectives will help you stay focused, motivated, and committed to making the most of this fresh start. Here are some goal-setting techniques and strategies to effectively plan your new year resolutions:

1. **S.M.A.R.T Goal Setting (Source 1)**
	* Specific - Make sure each goal is clearly defined and well-defined with no room for ambiguity.
	* Measurable - Determine a way to quantify the progress made towards each goal so you can track your achievements easily.
	* Attainable - Set goals that are challenging but not impossible. Break down large goals into smaller, manageable tasks to make them achievable.
	* Relevant - Ensure each goal aligns with your long-term vision and overall life priorities.
	* Time-bound - Assign deadlines or timeframes to each goal so you can stay on track and not lose momentum.
2. **Input/Output Method (Source 1)**
   Focus on input goals that relate to specific behaviors, such as practicing daily meditation for better mental health, rather than output goals like achieving total inner peace. This method helps you see how your daily actions directly contribute to the overall result you want to achieve.

	* Step 3: Write goals in positive, present-tense language to feel empowered and focused on achieving them.
	* Step 4: Measure progress by creating ways to evaluate your goal achievement regularly. Set daily check-ins or use a weekly journal entry system.
	* Step 5: Make yourself accountable by involving a partner, friend, family member, or joining a support group like Dr. Christina Hibbert's This is How We Grow Personal Growth Group on Facebook.
4. **Tips for New Year Goal Setting (Source 3)**
	* Write goals down and review them periodically: Place your goals where you will see them daily as reminders, or take photos to serve as visual cues on your computer or smartphone.
	* Set goals in different areas of life: Focus on one or two achievable goals per area (e.g., relationships, work, spirituality, health & fitness, finances) for positive results across multiple aspects of your life.
	* Make realistic and attainable goals: Break down large objectives into smaller steps that can be accomplished within the year. Examples include replacing nighttime snacks, paying off small debts, or updating your resume.
	* Set measurable goals: Track progress by setting specific, measurable objectives (e.g., sitting at the table with kids for five mornings a week, inviting friends out for coffee every other Wednesday).
	* Collaborate on goals with a partner: Team up with a friend or spouse to achieve your goal together, making it more enjoyable and less likely to give up.
	* Reward yourself for achieving goals: Celebrate milestones by treating yourself with non-conflicting rewards (e.g., girls' movie night, naps, extra savings).

Now that you have learned several techniques and strategies for effective goal setting, it's time to put these ideas into action and start planning your New Year's resolutions. With clear objectives in mind, the path towards personal growth and success becomes much easier to navigate.
